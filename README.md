# RTO Reminder Frontend

This is a minimal React + Vite frontend scaffold for the RTO WhatsApp Reminder System.

Quick start:

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The dev server runs on port 3001 and proxies `/api` to the backend at `http://localhost:3000` as configured in `vite.config.js`.

Notes:
- The UI is minimal and intended as a starting point. It expects the backend API endpoints described in the project to be available.
